 This is an HTML5 audio player *mostly* built from scratch (see comments in CSS and JS). My main goal here was to make this work in the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and IE... each having a color scheme that matches the native audio player styles.

It features basic player/playlist controls and everything works on touch devices as well.
